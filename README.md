A personal, 100% local meeting transcriber for macOS. I built it for myself.
I'm putting the source out there because other people asked — **not** because
I'm trying to ship a product.

There is no website, no installer, no support, no roadmap. If something
breaks, you fix it. If you want a feature, you add it. The project is MIT
licensed; fork it, strip it, reshape it — it's yours.

---

## What it does

- Detects when a Google Meet / Zoom / Teams / Whereby call opens in Arc,
  Safari, or Chrome and offers to start recording.
- Records your microphone **and** the system audio of the meeting as two
  separate tracks (so the transcript can label "You" vs "Remote").
- Transcribes both tracks with [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit)
  (Whisper Large v3 / v3 Turbo, CoreML / ANE).
- Diarizes the remote track with [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio)
  (Pyannote on CoreML) so multiple remote speakers get distinct labels.
- Saves `.md` + `.json` transcripts to `~/Documents/MeetingTranscripts/`.
- Optional on-device LLM summarization + action items + auto-titles via
  [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm) — Bielik for Polish,
  Qwen3.5 for English.
- Drag any `.mp4` / `.m4a` / `.mov` / `.wav` / `.mp3` onto the window to
  transcribe an existing recording.

## What this fork adds

On top of the original, this fork adds:

- **Ukrainian support** — replaces Polish. Transcription runs Whisper
  large-v3 for Ukrainian (turbo for English) by default; a per-term glossary
  + word-replacement pass cleans up domain jargon Whisper can't infer.
- **Summary export** — send a generated summary straight to a **Telegram**
  chat (Bot API), an **Obsidian** vault (as a dated markdown note), or a
  pre-filled **email** draft. Configure the destinations in Settings; nothing
  is sent unless you opt in.
- **Voice enrollment** — remember a speaker's voice once ("Andrii") and future
  meetings auto-label the same voice instead of "Remote 1/2". Uses FluidAudio's
  256-dim speaker embeddings + cosine matching, all on-device.
- **Transcript search** — a `search_transcripts` MCP tool for full-text search
  across every stored transcript, so an MCP client (e.g. Claude Code) can
  answer "what did we decide about X?" across all your meetings.
- **Live subtitles** — optional on-screen captions during a call via the Gemini
  Live API. Off by default; the app stays fully local otherwise.
- **Calendar integration** — pulls attendee names from the live calendar event
  as candidate speaker names.
- **Menu-bar-only** operation, plus recording/stability fixes (system-audio tap
  recovery, crash-safe recovery of interrupted recordings, arm64 build fixes).

## What it does not do

- No cloud. No telemetry. No account. No network calls except the first-run
  downloads of Whisper / diarizer / LLM weights from Hugging Face.
- No auto-update. No App Store. No notarized binary (build it yourself).
- No tests. No CI. No documented API. No backwards-compatibility promise.
- Not localised beyond English + Polish (the two languages I need).

Everything happens on your machine. If the network is off, models already
downloaded keep working.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or newer; M3+ strongly recommended for the 11B
  Polish model). Intel is not supported — MLX and WhisperKit both assume
  Apple Silicon.
- macOS 26 Tahoe. The UI uses Liquid Glass, `@Observable`, and other
  macOS 26 APIs. Older macOS will not build.
- Xcode 16+ and the Xcode Metal Toolchain (Xcode will prompt on first build,
  or you can pre-install with `xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`).
- [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) — `brew install xcodegen`.
- ~15 GB free disk space if you want to cache all the optional models.
- 32 GB RAM recommended for the larger LLMs (Qwen3.5-9B, Bielik-11B). 16 GB
  works for Qwen3.5-4B and the smaller Bielik variant.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/czlonkowski/simple-meeting-scribe
cd simple-meeting-scribe
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project MeetingTranscriber.xcodeproj \
           -scheme MeetingTranscriber \
           -configuration Debug \
           -destination 'platform=macOS' \
           -skipMacroValidation \
           build
```

Run the app from `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/.../Debug/MeetingTranscriber.app`,
or copy it into `/Applications` with `sudo cp -R …`.

## …or let an AI coding agent install it for you

If you already use [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Codex, or a
similar coding agent, paste this prompt into it and let it do the work. You'll
still need to approve Xcode / Homebrew / sudo prompts as they come up.

>
> 1. Verify prerequisites: Apple Silicon, macOS 26 or newer, Xcode 16+
>    installed. If Xcode Command Line Tools aren't installed, run
>    `xcode-select --install` and wait for it to finish.
> 2. Install xcodegen if missing: `brew install xcodegen` (install

> 3. Pre-download the Metal Toolchain so the build doesn't stall on it:
>    `xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`
> 4. Clone the repo into ~/Developer (create the directory if needed)
>    and `cd` into it:
>    `git clone https://github.com/czlonkowski/simple-meeting-scribe
>    ~/Developer/simple-meeting-scribe && cd ~/Developer/simple-meeting-scribe`
> 5. Generate the Xcode project: `xcodegen generate`
> 6. Build Release:
>    `xcodebuild -project MeetingTranscriber.xcodeproj
>    -scheme MeetingTranscriber -configuration Release
>    -destination 'platform=macOS' -skipMacroValidation
>    -derivedDataPath build build`

>     /Applications/ &&
>     sudo /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister
>     -f /Applications/MeetingTranscriber.app`
> 8. Open the app from /Applications once so macOS can register it, then
>    tell me:
>    - to grant Microphone + Screen Recording when prompted,
>    - to approve Automation access for Arc / Safari / Chrome on first
>      meeting detection,
>    - to open Settings → Summary → Model Library and download a model
>      before the first summarize (Qwen3.5-4B 8-bit for English,
>      Bielik-11B v3 for Polish are the defaults).

> **Why `-skipMacroValidation`?** MLX Swift LM ships compiler-plugin macros

> them on first use. The CLI flag skips that prompt. In Xcode GUI, click
> "Trust & Enable" on first build instead.

Because the app is ad-hoc signed, macOS will treat each install path as a
separate TCC identity. If you move the `.app` from DerivedData to
`/Applications`, you'll be asked to re-grant Microphone + Screen Recording
+ Automation (for browser AppleScript). This is macOS behaviour, not mine.

## First run

1. Launch. The dock icon is generated by `scripts/generate_app_icon.swift` —
   regenerate any time with `swift scripts/generate_app_icon.swift`.
2. Start a recording once; macOS will pop prompts for **Microphone** and
   **Screen Recording**. Approve both.
3. Open a meeting URL in Arc/Safari/Chrome. macOS will pop an **Automation**
   prompt for each browser the first time the app queries it.
4. Settings → **Summary** → Model Library → pick a model, click Download.
   Models live under `~/Documents/huggingface/models/`.

## Files on disk

- `~/Documents/MeetingTranscripts/` — transcripts (`.md` + `.json`).
- `~/Documents/MeetingTranscripts/recordings/` — the paired `.voice.wav`
  and `.system.wav` files for each session.
- `~/Documents/huggingface/models/` — downloaded LLM weights.
- Whisper models live under WhisperKit's own cache (first download shows
  progress inside the app).

Deleting a transcript from the sidebar (right-click → Delete) removes all
of the above for that session.

## Repo layout

```

`project.yml` drives everything — edit the YAML, run `xcodegen generate`,
never touch the `.xcodeproj` by hand.
